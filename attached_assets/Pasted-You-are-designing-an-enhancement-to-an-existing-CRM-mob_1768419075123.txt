You are designing an enhancement to an existing CRM mobile view used by a field sales team that sells to Brazilian municipalities (B2G).
The current screen already contains:

City header (city + state)

Deal stage stepper

Interaction history (notes, follow-ups)

Input to add notes after a visit

This screen is primarily used immediately after an in-person visit and must remain fast, scannable, and low-friction.

Objective

Design and specify the best UX solution to enrich this view with structured sales intelligence and post-visit qualification, without cluttering the interface.

Required Capabilities to Add
1. City Temperature Classification (Post-Visit)

Allow the seller to classify the commercial temperature of the city after the visit.

Requirements

Must be quick to fill (≤ 3 seconds)

Must not require typing by default

Must be visually scannable later in pipeline views

Expected UX Pattern

Discrete control (e.g., segmented control, chips, or swipe selector)

Clear semantic labels (e.g., 🔥 Quente, 🌤️ Morna, ❄️ Fria)

Optional tooltip or info icon explaining criteria (not mandatory to read)

2. Mark as Priority for Upcoming Weeks

Allow the seller to flag the city as priority for the next weeks.

Requirements

Binary action (priority / not priority)

Must be reversible

Must be visible at a glance when returning to the screen

Expected UX Pattern

Star / flag / pin icon near the city name

Optional secondary option: “priority until” (date picker only if expanded)

3. Sales Intelligence Panel (Read-Only, Structured)

Include a compact, structured information section to support the sales conversation.

Information to Display

VAAR status

Está no VAAR? (Sim / Não)

If “Não”: qual condicionalidade impede?

Political leadership

Prefeito: nome + partido

Vice-prefeito: nome + partido

Education leadership

Secretário(a) de Educação: nome

Education spending

Quanto a cidade já gastou em educação até o momento (R$)

Optional: % do orçamento (if available)

UX Constraints

Read-only (no editing in this screen)

Must not overwhelm the user

Must allow quick scanning during or after a visit

Expected UX Pattern

Collapsible section (“Informações estratégicas da cidade”)

Label → value layout

Use icons sparingly to aid scanning (e.g., 🏛️, 📚, 💰)

Graceful empty states (“Dados não disponíveis”)

UX & Product Principles to Follow

Progressive disclosure: advanced data hidden by default

Thumb-friendly: optimized for one-hand mobile use

Post-visit flow: temperature + priority should feel like a natural “wrap-up”

No modal overload: prefer inline or expandable sections

Brazilian public-sector context: language and labels in PT-BR

Deliverables Expected from You

UI structure proposal (sections and hierarchy)

Component recommendations (chips, icons, collapses, etc.)

Microcopy suggestions (labels, helper text)

Interaction flow (what the seller does in the last 30 seconds of a visit)

Optional: wireframe description (textual, no images required)

Design as if this will be used dozens of times per week by a field seller under time pressure.
